        Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
      </div>
      <div class="z-depth-2 grey darken-2 collapsible-body" style="border: none"><span class="faq-a flow-text">
        COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the disease. It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has just a mild cough and does not feel ill.<br>Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus. It is not yet known how often it happens. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the topic and will continue to share updated findings.

        How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?
      </div>
      <div class="z-depth-2 grey darken-2 collapsible-body" style="border: none"><span class="faq-a flow-text">
        Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.<br>When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating.

        What does it mean to self-isolate?
      </div>
      <div class="z-depth-2 grey darken-2 collapsible-body" style="border: none"><span class="faq-a flow-text">
        Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.<br>Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider’s recommendation. However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.

        What should I do if I have no symptoms, but I think I have been exposed to COVID-19? What does it mean to self-quarantine?
      </div>
      <div class="z-depth-2 grey darken-2 collapsible-body" style="border: none"><span class="faq-a flow-text">
        To self-quarantine means to separate yourself from others because you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 even though you, yourself, do not have symptoms.During self-quarantine you monitor yourself for symptoms.  The goal of the self-quarantine is to prevent transmission.  Since people who become ill with COVID-19 can infect people immediately self-quarantine can prevent some infections from happening.<br>
        In this case:
        <ol style="list-style-type: square">
          <li>Have a large, well-ventilated single room with hand hygiene and toilet facilities.</li>
          <li>If this is not available place beds at least 1 metre apart.</li>
          <li>Keep at least 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.</li>
          <li>Monitor your symptoms daily.</li>
          <li>Self-quarantine for 14 days, even if you feel healthy.</li>
          <li>If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately – call them first if possible.</li>
          <li>Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.</li>
          <li>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. <b>Seek medical help.</b></li>
          <li>When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.</li>

        What is the difference between self-isolation, self-quarantine and distancing?
      </div>
      <div class="z-depth-2 grey darken-2 collapsible-body" style="border: none"><span class="faq-a flow-text">
        Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19. The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms.<br>Isolation means separating people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease.<br>Physical distancing means being physically apart. WHO recommends keeping at least 1-metre distance from others. This is a general measure that everyone should take even if they are well with no known exposure to COVID-19.

        Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?
      </div>
      <div class="z-depth-2 grey darken-2 collapsible-body" style="border: none"><span class="faq-a flow-text">
        While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon research results become available.<br>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to:
        <ol style="list-style-type: square">
          <li>Clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.</li>
          <li>Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.</li>
          <li>Cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue. If a tissue is used, discard it immediately and wash your hands.</li>
          <li>Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others. </li>

        How long does the virus survive on surfaces?
      </div>
      <div class="z-depth-2 grey darken-2 collapsible-body" style="border: none"><span class="faq-a flow-text">
        The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.<br>As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

        Does WHO recommend wearing medical masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19?

        Medical masks are recommended primarily in health care settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below). Medical masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing.
